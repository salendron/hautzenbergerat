Wether you want some Tagliatelle or fill some Ravioli, you'll need a base noodle dough. This is what this recipe is for.

## Ingredients (for 3-4 servings)
* 200g of all purpose flour
* 200g of corn flour
* 100ml of cold water
* 1 teaspoon of salt

## Preperation
Knead all of the ingredients until you have a nice even dough. If it is too dry, add some olive oil, but keep in mind that the dough should not be sticky.
Put it in a platic bag, push out all of the air and close it. Now put it into the fridge for at least an hour. You can also store it there for up to 24 hours if you want to.
So, now you have dough to create any noodle you want. I would highly suggest to get yourself a noodle maschine, because it makes it far easier to get even noodles. Also always start at the thickest setting, get a bit of the dough through, fold it and do it again until it gets smooth. From there on slowly switch to thinner settings on your noodle maschine until the dough is as thin as you want it to be. Folding it on every thinner setting again is totally fine. It will only get smoother that way.
