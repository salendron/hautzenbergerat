I'm not a big cake-guy, but Brownies are something I really enjoy. It's like fluffy chocolate and with this recipe they are easy to prepare for everyone.

## Ingredients
* 80g of all purpose flour
* 1 package of backing powder
* 200g of chocolate
* 160g of sugar
* 4 eggs
* 200g butter

## Preperation
Melt the chocolate and the butter over a water bath. Now add all the other ingrredients and mix until you have a nice even batter.
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Take a big cake pan and butter it and put all pf the batter in. 
Bake it for 20 to 30 minutes (depending on how deep your pan is and your oven) and there you go, Brownie for days!
