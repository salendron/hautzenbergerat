Rural areas fascinate me for a rather strange reason. It's a world I do not fully understand and a world I don't belong to. When walking through small villages in rural areas I always feel like a visitor from a different world, even if the village is just 20km away from the city I live in. Old houses build between vast fields and dark forests, communities spread out over a large area, all of this leads to a different lifestyle and how people interact with each other. I went through the tiny roads of the village my wife is from  on a cold Saturday morning, just to find nothing but silence.
