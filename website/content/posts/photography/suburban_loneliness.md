On a cloudy sunday aftrnoon in August 2020 I took my grandfather's Agfa Isolette II, loaded a roll of Portra 400 Medium Format film and went for a walk in the suburbs of my Hometown.

## Alone
On days like this, in areas like this, you can feel the emptiness in the air. The weather and also the ongoing pandemic kept people inside. Walking through the streets felt like walking through a ghost town. It felt like everybody was gone and I am the last one here, looking at what was left behind.
